    <h1 class="image-desc">Santorini Islands, Greece</h1>
    <p class="about-country">Santorini (Greek: Σαντορίνη, pronounced [sandoˈrini]), officially Thira (Greek: Θήρα [ˈθira]) and classic Greek
        Thera (English pronunciation /ˈθɪərə/), is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast
        from the Greek mainland. It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago, which bears the same name
        and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera. It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands,
        with an area of approximately 73 km2 (28 sq mi) and a 2011 census population of 15,550. The municipality of
        Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, as well as the uninhabited islands of Nea
        Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi and Christiana. The total land area is 90.623 km2 (34.990 sq mi).[2] Santorini
        is part of the Thira regional unit.[3]

        It is the most active volcanic centre in the South Aegean Volcanic Arc, though what remains today is chiefly a
        water-filled caldera. The volcanic arc is approximately 500 km (310 mi) long and 20 to 40 km (12 to 25 mi) wide.
        The region first became volcanically active around 3-4 million years ago,[citation needed] though volcanism on
        Thera began around 2 million years ago with the extrusion of dacitic lavas from vents around Akrotiri. <br>
        Medieval and Ottoman period
        As with other Greek territories, Thera then was ruled by the Romans. When the Roman Empire was divided, the
        island passed to the eastern side of the Empire which today is known as the Byzantine Empire.[13] According to
        George Cedrenus, the volcano erupted again in the summer of 727, the tenth year of the reign of Leo III the
        Isaurian.[14] He writes: "In the same year, in the summer, a vapour like an oven's fire boiled up for days out
        of the middle of the islands of Thera and Therasia from the depths of the sea, and the whole place burned like
        fire, little by little thickening and turning to stone, and the air seemed to be a fiery torch." This terrifying
        explosion was interpreted as a divine omen against the worship of religious icons[15][16] and gave the Emperor
        Leo III the Isaurian the justification he needed to begin implementing his Iconoclasm policy.

        The name "Santorini" first appears c. 1153-1154 in the work of the Muslim geographer al-Idrisi, as "Santurin",
        from the island's patron saint, Saint Irene.[17] After the Fourth Crusade, it was occupied by the Duchy of Naxos
        which held it up to ca. 1280 when it was reconquered by Licario (the claims of earlier historians that the
        island had been held by Jacopo I Barozzi and his son as a fief have been refuted in the second half of the
        twentieth century);[18][19][20] it was again reconquered from the Byzantines ca. 1301 by Iacopo II Barozzi, a
        member of the Cretan branch of the Venetian Barozzi family, whose descendant held it until it was annexed in
        c. 1335 by Niccolo Sanudo after various legal and military conflicts.[21] In 1318–1331 and 1345–1360 it was
        raided by the Turkish principalities of Menteshe and Aydın, but did not suffer much damage.[17] From the 15th
        century on, the suzerainty of the Republic of Venice over the island was recognized in a series of treaties by
        the Ottoman Empire, but this did not stop Ottoman raids, until it was captured by the Ottoman admiral Piyale
        Pasha in 1576, as part of a process of annexation of most remaining Latin possessions in the Aegean.[17] It
        became part of the semi-autonomous domain of the Sultan's Jewish favourite, Joseph Nasi. Santorini retained its
        privileged position in the 17th century, but suffered in turn from Venetian raids during the frequent
        Ottoman–Venetian wars of the period, even though there were no Muslims on the island.[17]

        Santorini was captured briefly by the Russians under Alexey Orlov during the Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774, but
        returned to Ottoman control after. Following the outbreak of the Greek War of Independence on the Greek mainland
        in March 1821, in May Santorini followed suit, although the local Catholic population had its reservations. The
        island became part of the fledgling Greek state, rebelled against Governor Ioannis Kapodistrias in 1831, and
        became definitively part of the independent Kingdom of Greece in 1832, with the Treaty of Constantinople.[17]
